# Depositing Money
To deposit money only to your account, you need to have an account. It doesn't matter from which address you send money, because in the transaction there is a hidden message including the target account id. The same rules can be applied to donating to a specific user *(Altho, in that case, you would rather want to send money directly to a specific address.)*. It also doesn't matter what available network you choose to use.

So let's begin:

1. In your [dashboard](https://ethuardo.com/dashboard/) panel, find a Menu cart, and inside of it find the deposit button, which leads to your [deposit](https://ethuardo.com/deposit) page.

    3. Enter your deposit amount.
