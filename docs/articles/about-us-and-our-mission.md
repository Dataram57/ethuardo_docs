So, this will be the first article on our Medium account. I have decided to create this account to get more interested in this project audience, by writing related articles on this platform. Ethuardo.com is a cryptocurrency-only based marketplace for digital assets. It is not a crypto cantor nor an NFT marketplace like OpenSea. Our goal is to create an open-for-everyone and transparent marketplace to sell their digital products. We handle money transfers, as well as package delivery. We use blockchains to give users better security and confirmation of owning the assets that they have or actions that they do on the site. However, for the sake of making useless and trashy transactions on blockchains, we allow some things to be kept off-chain. That’s why we see this project as something between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

By digital assets, we mean things that we are used to buying on the internet. Art, Games, 3D Models, Mods, Maps, Sounds, Pictures, Tools, etc… While we seek potential in completely new fields of Web 3.0, we want to first let the people from Web 2.0 give a simple and easy taste of what Web 3.0 has to offer. So we take a problem solved by Web 2.0 and convert it into a Web 3.0 one. But why?

> ***Question** : Why would anyone want to use cryptocurrencies instead of traditional ways of payment?
<br><br>**Answer**: Mainly because cryptocurrencies are not only about money but about a world where we have better control over things we "own". Ask yourself, how much is "yours" your email, phone number, cloud files, face ID, money balance, or even food when you have it all provided by 1 single company or the government. Such a scheme of life would have only 1 point of failure which would take everything from you that you have "owned" there.
<br><br>**Question**: Then why won’t we diversify our things over multiple companies? I would still have the essence of traditionalism kept well right?
<br><br>**Answer**: Well, not really. What we couldn’t stop as humanity for many many years was the progress. Companies may not look like they are connected at first. But if you dive deeper you will eventually find that they communicate with each other, and with time, the nature of war or capitalism will eventually start to take over these companies and merge them into 1 single. And so eventually nothing will change.*

The solution that we offer to solve this dilemma is to use solutions of a new Web 3.0. In other words, we want to lead the world to become more self-reliant while also keeping in mind costs and equal chances for everyone.
