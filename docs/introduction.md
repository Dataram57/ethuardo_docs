# Introduction
Ethuardo is an open marketplace designed specifically for digital creators who wants to sell their assets through cryptocurrencies. As a user, you can buy and sell any assets you want as long as they don't break the rules of the service. As a buyer, you can buy any assets you want while keeping the same level of anonymity as your public blockchain address has. You don't have to register your account with any e-mail or phone number. But as a buyer, you are obligated to follow the rules written in EULA attached to the product that you have bought.

The service aims to be as transparent as it can through various solutions that the blockchain offers. Service uses blockchain and other trustless technologies to make the service more trustless, and so more safe because the client has better proof that the service will not lie to him. But please don't forget, the service still stays centralized, and so you must include the risks that come with that.

As a digital creator, you have a chance to share your work here for money, and earn it in crypto like a true dealer ;). But you have to respect rules and have a responsibility that comes with that. Generally speaking, don't post any controversial or someone's copyrighted products. Rely on your own creativity instead, and don't post any NFT-like or AI-generated assets.
